[00:07.20] Moon's up high, shining wide
[00:09.01] Counting sheep on my bed
[00:11.45] Who's still awake, tossing and turning?
[00:14.52] Little lamb, wool so white
[00:16.35] Why're you hiding from the rest?
[00:18.85] Glow in the dark, come when the sun sets
[00:22.54] (Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah)
[00:24.34] (Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah)
[00:26.30] I ring my bell, I ring my bell
[00:29.30] Meadow grass swaying slow
[00:31.11] Gentle green with hints of gold
[00:33.65] The twilight paints the end of summer
[00:36.66] Electric sheep, do you dream
[00:38.51] Of machines in your sleep?
[00:41.02] Or do you dream of running far and free?
[00:44.62] (Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah)
[00:46.47] (Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah)
[00:48.38] I ring my bell, I ring my bell
[00:52.12] (Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah)
[00:53.91] (Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah)
[00:55.77] I ring my bell, I ring my bell
[00:58.81] Oh, DAMI DAMI DAMIO
[01:01.11] Sunlight'll tell me where to go
[01:03.22] We laugh and run, all night long
[01:06.65] DAMI DAMI DAMIO
[01:08.53] River guides the way we roam
[01:10.58] When night is gone, journey will carry on
[01:14.18] To the secret untold, to the wonder we hold
[01:17.70] Running out the woods we know, little sheep we tip-tap-toe
[01:21.67] I wandered high and low, now I don't walk alone
[01:25.35] Together, on we go (ooh)
[01:31.90] Let's find a way out
[01:35.73] Moon's up high, shining wide
[01:37.56] Set my heart upon a quest
[01:40.09] I'm by myself, but far from lonely
[01:43.06] Little lamb, wool so white
[01:44.94] Why're you running on your own?
[01:47.53] I'm just like you, searching for where I belong
[01:51.14] (Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah)
[01:52.89] (Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah)
[01:58.34] Round and round and round we go
[02:00.15] To the end I'll keep you close
[02:02.22] I'll follow you and be your shadow
[02:05.75] Round and round and round we go
[02:07.57] Count the stars, then off you go
[02:09.65] If I catch you, promise don't hide again
[02:14.50] Again
[02:15.38] I ring my bell
[02:18.81] I ring my bell
[02:21.48] DAMI DAMI DAMIO
[02:23.28] Sing the song we used to know
[02:25.33] We ride the winds into the wild
[02:28.86] DAMI DAMI DAMIO
[02:30.67] Sing so loud the sky will know
[02:32.76] We laugh, we run, until the break of dawn
[02:36.24] To the secret untold, to the wonder we hold
[02:39.97] Running out the woods we know, little sheep we tip-tap-toe
[02:43.90] I wandered high and low, now I don't walk alone
[02:47.53] Together, on we go
[02:51.29] The stars will take me home
